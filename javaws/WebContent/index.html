<h1>HLT ConfDB GUI</h1>

<h3>Click <a href="start.jnlp">here</a> to start the HLT ConfDB GUI via Java Web Start</h3>

<p>The HLT ConfDB GUI is a signed Java application; the signing certificate was granted by the
<a href="https://ca.cern.ch/ca/">CERN Certification Authority</a> to the "CMS ConfDB" account.<br>
To verify the certificate, please install the <a href="https://cafiles.cern.ch/cafiles/certificates/CERN%20Root%20Certification%20Authority%202.crt">
CERN Root Certification Authority 2 Certificate</a>.</p>

<h3>Building the GUI</h3>
<p>You will need the <code>git</code> client, the <code>ant</code> build tool, and a Java 1.8 JDK installed:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/cms-sw/hlt-confdb.git
cd hlt-confdb
ant gui
./start
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Connection details</h3>
<p>In order to work, the GUI needs to connect to one of the Oracle database at CERN.<br>
The offline database <b>HLTDEVv2</b> should be accessible from the CERN network and from all (most?) institutes
that belong to the CMS collaboration.<br>
The online database <b>DAQv2</b> is accessible only from the .CMS network at Point 5, while its read-only
copy <b>ORCOFFv2</b> is accessible from the CERN network. An ssh tunnel can be used to connect from outside.</p>

<p>You can test the connection to the offline database with
<pre>
telnet cmsr1-s.cern.ch 10121
</pre>
If the output is something like
<pre>
Trying 10.116.96.88...
Connected to db-rac-349.cern.ch.
Escape character is '^]'.
</pre>
then you can connect to the database.<br>
If the output is something like
<pre>
Trying 10.116.96.88...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
</pre>
then you cannot connect directly to the database, and you need to use a tunnel.<br>
<p>If you are working from an institute outside CERN, please write to
<a href="mailto:Franck Pachot <franck.pachot@cern.ch> ?cc=Andrea Bocci <andrea.bocci@cern.ch>" target="_blank">
Franck Pachot (cc Andrea Bocci)</a> providing the IP address range for your institute,
and ask to allow it through the CMS database firewall.</p>

<p> Note its probably easier just to tunnel the connection though...</p>

<h3>Connection through a tunnel</h3>
<p>Currently the preferred method to connect is to create a dynamic
forwarding through an ssh connection to lxplus:
<pre>
ssh -f -N -D 1080 lxplus.cern.ch
</pre>
then start the GUI, select the HLTDEVv2 (socks tunnel) option<br>
Change the proxy port number if you used a different local port. </p>

<p>If this approach does not work, it is also possible to forward a port.
Forward the local port 10121 to the database server through an ssh connection to lxplus:
<pre>
ssh -f -N -L 10121:10.116.96.89:10121 lxplus.cern.ch
</pre>
then start the GUI, select the HLTDEVv2 (direct tunnel) option.
Change the server port number if you used a different local port.
</p>
